# Background
The general objectives of my brainhack project is to wrap up a first working version of a library I, and others, have developed over the past year or so, called brainsprite. Brainsprite started as a simple experiment: could one use native html functionalies to convert a "sprite" image composed of several sagital slices into an interactive brain viewer. The key functionality is the ability to draw a portion of an image onto the screen. Iterating (x100) this approach over rows/columns of sagital slices allow one to draw axial and coronal slices. This is a technique used to animate characters in web-based video games. I was wondering how fast it would be when animating brain slices. Turns out it is really, really [fast](https://simexp.github.io/brainsprite.js/tests/example_basic.html). Also, the brain volume now ships as an image, so using a lossy format like jpg makes it very easy to load, and quite small. My original motivation was not simply speed, but also having a simple API to read coordinates click by the user along with corresponding value, updating coordinates, loading/unloading overlays etc. Turned out this was not too complicated to make either, and the whole library is less than 500 lines. This means that brainsprite can be used as a building block for dashboards linking multiple data visualization (plots, matrices, etc) with one or multiple brain viewers. This project is more or less in a usable form, with the documentation living [here](https://simexp.github.io/brainsprite.js).

# The next stage
However, most people who do neuroimaging will find this library next to useless. First, you need to know at least a bit of html and javascript to use it. Which is a huge blocker to start with. Second, there is no streamlined solution to generate the sprite brain images. So users need to find a way to generate them, and also take note of important meta data (size of each slice in the sprite). So basically brainsprite is currently only targeting a handful of neuroimaging developers who are comfortable manipulating brain images and want to build interactive web-based dashboards.

The next step, started mostly by Christian Dansereau and Sebastian Urchs, has been to develop a python library called spritipy that streamlines the generation of sprites, as well as html snippets ready to integrate in a webpage. Also, a work-in-progress feature is to inject html code in a notebook, so that the interactive brain viewer is part of the notebook. An advantage of brainsprite over equivalent solutions, as far as I know, is that it works entirely client-side from an embedded image. So it could be possibly rendered even if the notebook server is not running, and the data/library are lightweight. I would also like to model the API of spritipy on plot_stat_maps from the nilearn library, so that the learning curve for nilearn users is close to zero.

# Specific learning objectives and deliverables
During the brainhack school, I'd like to finish spritipy. This involves a few things:
  * re-work the API for spritipy, and update the code that is currently available. I need to learn about jupyter widgets to make it work.
  * create some documentation. I would like to learn sphynx to do it.
  * create some kind of community guidelines, and "easy issues". Never done that before, but would likely model some of that content from the mulit-echo package of Elizabeth.
  * eventually would like to integrate spritipy directly in nilearn, which would require me to make a pull request. Although I have done it several times within my own projects, that would be the first time for me contributing to an external project that way, and I will need to learn how to do it properly.
